# Shrimpys-Backwoods-Workshop
At Shrimpy’s Backwoods Workshop, we handcraft custom wood goods with rustic charm and precision. From furniture to gifts, we build to order, offering laser engraving for logos or personal touches. Need something unique? We also offer 3D printing to bring your custom ideas to life—backwoods style.
